# Wallpaper userstyle for Microsoft Teams

This is a very basic userstyle that adds a wallpaper to Microsoft Teams.

Images are taken from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos) and applied in the background, with options for transparency and blurriness.

To configure the style, simply edit the variables in the `:root` rule.
